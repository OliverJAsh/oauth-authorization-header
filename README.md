# oauth-authorization-header

Generates OAuth `Authorization` header.

Under the hood, this module generates the string using the [battle-tested code](https://github.com/request/request/blob/b12a6245d9acdb1e13c6486d427801e123fdafae/lib/oauth.js#L130) hidden inside the popular [request] library. The request library is concerned about making requests, and thus does not document its standalone OAuth API, nor does it make it very easy to useâ€”hence the existence of this module.

The library is written in TypeScript and is published in JavaScript with type declaration files.

## Installation

```
yarn add oauth-authorization-header
```
